    <h2>Lithuanian Potato-Meat Dumplings</h2>
    <p>Lithuanian potato-meat dumplings are known as zeppelins or cepelinai 
      because of their shape. These hearty and rich dumplings take some time 
      to make, but they are well worth the effort. Don't be intimidated by the 
      recipe as it has a few steps in order to make each component, including 
      the filling, the dumpling, and the gravy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The potatoes for cepelinai are prepared in two ways—raw potatoes, which 
      are peeled and grated, and then cooked potatoes, which are peeled, boiled, 
      and riced. A potato ricer is a handy and useful tool to have to prepare them.
      Use your favorite ground meat combination for the recipe, we have offered 
      alternate suggestions in our tips below.

      The national dish of Lithuania, cepelinai are best served and eaten as soon 
      as made. The cooked dumplings are hard to store, and are best piping hot and 
      covered with hot gravy.

    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation instructions</h3>
    <p><strong>Making the meat filling:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix together ground meat, finely chopped onion, 
        the salt, a few grinds of pepper, and the egg until well combined.</li>
      <li>Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Making the dumplings:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Add the lemon juice to the raw grated potatoes so they don't turn brown.</li>
      <li>Place them in a fine-mesh cheesecloth or cotton dishtowel, and twist over
        a large bowl to get rid of the excess water.</li>
      <li>Pour off the water, reserving the potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
      <li>Unwrap the cheesecloth and place the raw potatoes in the bowl with the 
        potato starch you reserved from the bottom of the bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked riced potatoes, grated onion, and the salt, more to taste. 
        Mix well.</li>
      <li>Put a large stockpot of well-salted water on to boil.</li>
      <li>To form the zeppelins, take about 1 cup of dumpling mixture and pat it flat
        in the palm of the hand.</li>
      <li>Place 1/4 cup or more of meat mixture in the center and, using slightly 
        dampened hands, fold the potato mixture around the meat into a football 
        shape, sealing well. Continue until both mixtures are used.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Cooking the dumplings:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Carefully lower dumplings (in batches if necessary to prevent crowding)
        into salted, boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of cornstarch has been 
        added (to prevent dumplings from falling apart). Make sure water returns to
        the boil; reduce the heat to low and continue simmering until the filling is 
        cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix together ground meat, finely chopped onion, 
        the salt, a few grinds of pepper, and the egg until well combined.</li>
      <li>Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon or strainer, drain briefly 
        on a clean dish towel and place on a heated platter.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Preparing the gravy:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>While the dumplings are boiling, make the gravy. In a medium skillet, 
        fry the bacon and chopped onion until tender.</li>
      <li>Drain and combine with sour cream and black pepper. Thin with 1 to 2 
        tablespoons milk if necessary.</li>
      <li>Ladle the gravy over the dumplings or pass the gravy at the table.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If your cepelinai tend to fall apart, try adding a few tablespoons of dry 
        potato starch to the potato mixture along with the reserved wet starch.</li>
      <li>A Lithuanian potato grater is an excellent option, but if you aren't 
        able to find one, grate the raw potatoes with the smallest grater holes 
        then pulse them in a food processor until smooth.</li>
      <li>Instead of cheesecloth or a dish cloth, use a nut milk bag to wring out 
        excess water.</li>
      <li>Let the potato water settle for a few minutes before pouring it off—the 
        pasty starch will remain in the bottom of the bowl.</li>
      <li>A potato ricer makes the preparation of the cooked potatoes much easier.</li>
