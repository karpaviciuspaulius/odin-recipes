    <h2>Traditional Potato Pancaces</h2>
    <p>
      This is one of the easiest recipes to make the potato pancakes. Most of
      Lithuanians make potato pancakes according to this recipe. At least in
      this way potato pancakes were made in my grandparents and my mother&#39s
      house. Of course, the recipe can be adapted according to everyone&#39s taste
      &#45 the ones who like more vegetables can add carrot and zucchini. If you
      want more flavors &#45 add garlic, dil or parsley. If you prefer a slightly
      different consistency of pancakes &#45 add the curd cheese or light cheese
      (like Edam, Gouda, etc.) into the mass.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the potato pancake mass can be prepared in a few minutes if 
      you have an electric potato grater. But if you don&#39t have it, then use 
      the grater with outward protruding holes with spiky edges on all sides.
