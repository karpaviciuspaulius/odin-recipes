    <h2>Lithuanian Saltibarsciai (Cold Beet Soup)</h2>
    <p>
      In Lithuania, there&39:s really only one thing to do with beetroot and that&39:s 
      make cold borscht soup, known in Lithuania as šaltibarščiai (shalt-eh-barsh-chay). 
      This garishly pink soup is incredible popular, particularly in summer when the 
      weather can be quite hot. It is made using a cultured milk called kefir 
      (kefyras in Lithuanian), which is like a cross between yoghurt and buttermilk. 
      Because it is contains high quantities of beneficial bacteria and yeasts, 
      kefir is very good for your digestive system. Couple that with the benefits of 
      eating the “superfood” that is beetroot and you have a highly nutritious lunch!</p>
